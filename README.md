# FinalBossAnonymity
Tails OS is like the final boss of anonymity. It’s designed to leave no trace, route everything through Tor, and even wipes memory on shutdown.
# 🧊 Why Use Tails OS Over Any other OS (Including KALI) 
 - this info can give you nothing if you're on blackarch (I know you're too advanced and if you're using 13+ custom kernel don't even ask something)

## 🔒 Total Anonymity
- All traffic is routed **only through Tor**, by default.
- Automatic **DNS & IP leak protection**.
- **MAC address spoofing** is enabled at every boot.

## 🧹 Leaves No Trace
- Runs entirely from **RAM**, with no data left behind.
- **Wipes all memory** on shutdown.
- Doesn't touch internal storage unless you explicitly allow it.

## 🔐 Optional Persistent Storage
- Save VPN configs, bookmarks, and passwords securely.
- Fully **encrypted and isolated** from the system.
- Easy to enable after first boot.

## 🧭 No Installation Required
- Just plug in the USB and boot.
- No need for dual-booting or messing with hard drives.
- Great for **“clean” missions** where zero trace is critical.

## 💻 Hardened for Privacy
- Comes preloaded with a hardened **Tor Browser**.
- No root by default = harder for malware to do damage.
- Only includes tools needed for secure communication.
